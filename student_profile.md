## About Me
- **Major/Program:** No current major; aiming for McMaster Health Sciences

- **Interests:** I am primarily interested in the field of biology, which is in-part due to my fascination for the medical field.

## Experience

- **Why I'm Taking This Course:** While I am familiar with the concept of Python, my expertise with the subject is still in its infancy. As such, I hope to cultivate my knowledge of this programming language throughout this course.

## Goals
- **What I Want to Learn:** I hope to leave this class with a renewed understanding for coding, as well as a newfound appreciation for the effort that goes into the digital products we take for granted. I would like to learn more about the idea of object-oriented programming, as I feel that it plays a huge role in the world of video games (a medium of entertainment I am very passionate about).
- **Career Interests:** I am chiefly interested in the medical field; the likes of which blossomed from my fascinations for chemistry and biology. Human anatomy and systems were the most captivating subjects for me, which lends itself well for medical occupations.

## Fun Fact
Before the medical field, I was initially interested in the field of visual arts. This passion, unfortunately, crumbled following realizations relating to the realities of the animation industry.
